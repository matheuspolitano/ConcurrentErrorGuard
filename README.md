## Overview 
My goal was to integrate goroutines into the performance data collection process. This integration is aimed at harnessing the full potential of Go's concurrency capabilities, allowing us to process AJAX performance data simultaneously.

A key requirement we faced was the need to halt all goroutines upon encountering an error in any one of them, and to preserve the errant data for further analysis. In this context, I aim to explore various strategies for managing errors within goroutines.

Direct Return Values
Is it feasible to return values directly from goroutines as we would in a standard function? This approach is generally advised against in concurrent programming. The rationale behind this is the risk of return values from different goroutines overwriting each other, leading to a scenario where you might only process the output of a single goroutine out of many. A similar discussion can be found on Stack Overflow.

Example:
``` go
var result int
go func() {
    result = action()
}()
// Here, 'result' may be overwritten by different goroutines
```
Returning through Channels
The most reliable method to collect return values from multiple goroutines without them interfering with each other is through channels. There are several ways to use return channels:

- Utilize the return channel exclusively for errors.
- Design the channel to return both the result and any errors.
- Separate Channels for Results and Errors
